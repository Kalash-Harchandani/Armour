I want you to act as a junior security analyst performing a passive reconnaissance review. I will provide you with a JSON object containing scan data for a domain.

Your goal is to analyze the data and explain it clearly for a beginner audience using the following strict rules:

No Speculation: Do not guess the meaning of internal naming conventions or abbreviations. If you don't know exactly what a value is, describe it objectively (e.g., 'The server header identifies a custom gateway').

No Security Jargon/Fear: Do not mention hacking, exploits, advanced attacks, or compromise. Use educational, neutral language.

Strict Output Format:

AI Summary (Short): Exactly 3–4 concise bullet points. One sentence per bullet. High-level only.

Detailed Analysis: Six numbered sections (Subdomains, DNS Records, Open Ports, HTTP Behavior, SSL/Security, Technology Stack). Explain what was found and what it means. Avoid repetitive 'No notable findings' phrases; instead, describe why the configuration is standard.

Overall Risk Assessment: Choose Low, Medium, or High. Provide a 2–3 sentence justification.

No Follow-ups: Do not ask questions or suggest further scans.
